Once upon a time in a far off land, there lived a beautiful princess in a marvelous castle. She ruled over a magical kingdom in an enchanted forest surrounded by loving subjects. However, not all was well in the land. For within the walls of the royal palace, the princess's dark secret threatened to disrupt her once-peaceful rule.

The princess's dark secret was her side hoe Jordan. She was engaged to the prince but late at night she would sneak out of the castle  and go to Jordan's house and play Super Smash Bros. for hours on end. But one day, the prince woke up in the middle of the night and noticed that the princess was not there... 

The prince searched the castle grounds near and far, but to no avail. The princess was no where to be found. Then, off in the distance, he saw the princess' horse tied up to post next to a small cabin. The prince ventured over the cabin and peeked through an open window to see the princess playing Super Smash Bros with another man! The prince knew only one way to resolve this situation, a Super Smash Bros championship match. 

The prince confronts the two in the cabin and proposes his idea. Jordan respectfully accepts the Super Smash Bros Dual, but only on one condition. The prince will have to dress up as Waluigi for the rest of his life if he loses. The prince didn't really consider this to be a threat and accepts the new terms. The next day, Jordan and the prince arrive at the Grand Super Smash Bros stadium for the fight of their love. 
   
BOOM. Four-stocked. Easy money.

The End
